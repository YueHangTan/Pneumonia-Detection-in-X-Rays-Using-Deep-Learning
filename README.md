1. Dataset was downloaded from the following url:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia

2. The notebook "Pneumonia X-Ray Images Classification Model Building" is the one building the deep learning model. Please input your own directory to the dataset in the 2nd cell.

3. The H5 file "densenet_model_recall9947" is the trained model that gives good recall score as demonstrated during the presentation. Keep this model in a directory of your choice as this will be useful for the application.

4. The notebook "CustomTkinter App" is the one that build and launch the application. Please input your own directory to the "densenet_model_recall9947" trained model in the 4th cell.
	- You might need to install CustomTkinter to run this notebook.

5. Lastly, the two PDF files are presentation slides and final report respectively.


That's about it. Let me know if you encounter any issue to run any of the notebook / script.
